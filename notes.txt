Need a little reorganization.
Needs optomization and some structural changes. 
Currently a bit messy.


TO ADD - 
    - Add a way to render numbers and letters.
    - Basic Shape dimensions
    - Shape nester
    - Other file types (STP, STL, ETC)
    - File Converter (DWG -> STP etc) Probably use some sort of IR for this.
    - add swizzling
    
    // If none of the corners are in view, the object can be culled
    return false;


Camera rotation is messed up need to fix

restructure g to a simple list of points where each point has an owner
massive optomization and simplifies things
