Need a little reorganization.
Needs optomization and some structural changes. 
Currently a bit messy.


TO ADD - 
    - Add a way to render numbers and letters.
    - Basic Shape dimensions
    - Shape nester
    - 3D support
    - Other file types (STP, STL, ETC)
    - File Converter (DWG -> STP etc) Probably use some sort of IR for this.
    - add swizzling
    

    Parse the DXF file and extract the extrusion vector: The extrusion vector is a normal vector to the base plane of a planar entity. It is usually stored as a 3D vector in the DXF file.
import ezdxf

def get_extrusion_vector(entity):
    # Extract the extrusion vector from the entity
    return entity.dxf.extrusion

Project the entity’s coordinates onto the 2D plane: To project the 3D entity’s coordinates onto the 2D plane, you can use dot and cross products. The following code snippet demonstrates how to project a point onto a plane.
def project_point_on_plane(point, normal_vector):
    # Calculate the projection vector
    projection_vector = point - dot_product(point, normal_vector) * normal_vector

    # Project the point onto the plane
    projected_point = projection_vector + dot_product(point, normal_vector) * normal_vector

    return projected_point

def dot_product(vector1, vector2):
    return sum(map(lambda x, y: x * y, vector1, vector2))

Apply the extrusion: After projecting the 3D entity’s coordinates onto the 2D plane, you can apply the extrusion by creating a new entity with the projected 2D coordinates and the extrusion vector.
def apply_extrusion(entity, extrusion_vector, height):
    # Project the entity's coordinates onto the 2D plane
    projected_points = [project_point_on_plane(point, extrusion_vector) for point in entity.points]

    # Create a new entity with the projected 2D coordinates and the extrusion vector
    new_entity = MyDXFEntity(points=projected_points, extrusion=extrusion_vector, height=height)

    return new_entity

Please note that the provided code snippets are just examples and might need adjustments depending on the specific DXF file format and the entities you want to process. The MyDXFEntity class is a placeholder for the actual DXF entity class you are working with.
