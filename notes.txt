Need a little reorganization.
Needs optomization and some structural changes. 
Currently a bit messy.
Make parent child system for entity.
make arcs only store 4 points but render using x amount for visual clarity and performance.
loop through all entitys to find where user clicked.



Need to store location of where points are in space after rotation in order
to grab when raycasting


TO ADD - 
    - Add a way to render numbers and letters.
    - Basic Shape dimensions
    - Shape nester
    - Other file types (STP, STL, ETC)
    - File Converter (DWG -> STP etc) Probably use some sort of IR for this.
    - add swizzling
    
restructure g to a simple list of points where each point has an owner
massive optomization and simplifies things
