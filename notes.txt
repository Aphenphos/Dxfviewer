Need a little reorganization.
Needs optomization and some structural changes. 
Currently a bit messy.


TO ADD - 
    - Add a way to render numbers and letters.
    - Basic Shape dimensions
    - Shape nester
    - 3D support
    - Other file types (STP, STL, ETC)
    - File Converter (DWG -> STP etc) Probably use some sort of IR for this.
    - add swizzling
    



    // If none of the corners are in view, the object can be culled
    return false;


Camera rotation is messed up need to fix

Rotation is called trackball rotation,

    get where the camera is looking and rotate around that point.
    find centeroid of all objects
        rotate about the centeroid
        this removes all dependant relations aka (shapes)
