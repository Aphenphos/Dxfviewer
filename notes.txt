Need a little reorganization.
Needs optomization and some structural changes. 
Currently a bit messy.


TO ADD - 
    - Add a way to render numbers and letters.
    - Basic Shape dimensions
    - Shape nester
    - Other file types (STP, STL, ETC)
    - File Converter (DWG -> STP etc) Probably use some sort of IR for this.
    - add swizzling
    
restructure g to a simple list of points where each point has an owner
massive optomization and simplifies things
